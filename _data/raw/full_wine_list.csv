Sometimes I get sick of the American oakiness of our Chardonnays. But this is one of those times where I am missing that flavor profile. I usually love Chablis for this reason but it‚Äôs just missing too much!

Especially for the summer. Apple, pear, minerals like salt, maybe a little bit of oak and honey, but just slightly enough not to overpower. Over course acidity adds citrus and lemon too.

Then it changed. Flavors of sour cherry, blueberry, cranberry, and black currant. A bit later, you get spiciness of Aleppo pepper, salt, and chalk.

However it tastes cheap and alcoholic. Like most chardonnays I get butter, and maybe some pear. There‚Äôs another flavor I don‚Äôt like. that‚Äôs about it. I‚Äôm going to give it a second tasting.

This is one of my favorite wines I‚Äôve ever had. I got so many flavors that seemed to morph as I finished my glass. I get cherry, cranberry, salt, and chocolate. I really enjoyed it with a sharp or salty üßÄ.

It‚Äôs perfectly balanced with not too much butter but just the right amount, which leads its cream flavor. I also get green apple, cheese, pear, and grapefruit - which makes a perfect balance between oaky and acidic citrus.
