Taylor's,20 Year Old Tawny Port,,Porto,Portugal,Tawny Port,4.3,,The Mick Brasserie + Bar,4.0,"8.0 out of 10 - This was phenomenal! Didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd like it, as I‚Äôm not usually a dessert wine fan. I got flavors of  Caramel, creme brulee, marzipan, medjool date, and raisin, a little bit of almond.

Domaine Schaller Camille & Laurent,Chablis,2022.0,Chablis,France,Burgundy Chablis,3.8,,The Mick Brasserie + Bar,2.7,"5.4 out of 10 - almost tasted like water for me. I wanted more flavor - in any way. Pear, salt, and peach but not much else. 

Sometimes I get sick of the American oakiness of our Chardonnays. But this is one of those times where I am missing that flavor profile. I usually love Chablis for this reason but it‚Äôs just missing too much!

Got a glass for my mom‚Äôs birthday at the Mick.",,White Wine,,https://www.vivino.com/wines/171633809,

I get flavors of strawberry, grass, salt, peach, and a melon.

Krasno,Orange (White Wine with Maceration),,Gori≈°ka Brda,Slovenia,Slovenian White,3.9,,Carcara,3.7,"7.5 out of 10 - shame I didn‚Äôt rate this the first time around when I had it. It‚Äôs incredible! Almost tastes like a Chardonnay, but just with a little more funk from the skin contact.

I get flavors of tangerine, minerals, peach, honey, oak butter, cream, and a slight bit of grapefruit.

Especially for the summer. Apple, pear, minerals like salt, maybe a little bit of oak and honey, but just slightly enough not to overpower. Over course acidity adds citrus and lemon too.

I usually regret ordering a bottle at a restaurant but I really enjoyed this. It is my first time rating this varietal. Split a bottle at Pa‚Äôla with a incredible woman.",,White Wine,,https://www.vivino.com/wines/170678448,https://images.vivino.com/labels/R0IwDn4lSCKglKupXlDYvQ.jpg

You get some great flavors - blackberry, pepper, chili pepper, cinnamon, and blueberry. For the oak you get an earthy tobacco.

I like spicy food, so it makes sense I‚Äôd like such a complex and spice filled wine ü•µ üòç",,Red Wine,,https://www.vivino.com/wines/178377178,https://images.vivino.com/labels/FQnO2FDjQF-MNto03nJrLQ.jpg

I got cranberry, cherry, chalk, leather, black cherry, and a little bit of oak.

I am definitely going to try more Nero d‚ÄôAvolas

First & Local,Chardonnay,2021.0,California,United States,Californian Chardonnay,3.6,2025-05-26 22:11:04,,3.2,"6.2 out of 10 - pretty average Chardonnay for its price. At $11.99 at Total Wine, it‚Äôs pretty hard to beat the value. So it‚Äôs great wine to serve at a party.

Relatively unoaked, but you get a little with vanilla. Other than that, I get pear, apple, stone, and minerals.",,White Wine,,https://www.vivino.com/wines/168480726,https://images.vivino.com/labels/r5l2CLqCSlWTH8szSfu7DQ.jpg

Then it changed. Flavors of sour cherry, blueberry, cranberry, and black currant. A bit later, you get spiciness of Aleppo pepper, salt, and chalk.

It‚Äôs a JS91, which I usually don‚Äôt put much stock in, but I agreed with this rating. And at $11 a bottle it is definitely a steal.",,Red Wine,,https://www.vivino.com/wines/173818146,https://images.vivino.com/labels/gzX2lg7_QbWSmqYM7OJTZA.jpg

I get flavors of like a blueberry muffin, leather, plum jam, and tobacco. Typically, I don‚Äôt really like Pinot Noirs but I kind of like this one.

Casa Lunardi,Pinot Grigio,,delle Venezie,Italy,Northern Italy Pinot Grigio,3.8,,POMO Pizzeria - Biltmore,3.0,"6.0 out of 10 - subpar Pinot Grigio for me. But I may be being unfair. But right now it just tastes like tastes like a super sweet lemonade.

I get flavors of lemon zest, honey, and grapefruit. Would try again for maybe a retaste when I wasn‚Äôt so grumpy - although I did enjoy the Pinot Nero at the same restaurant.",,White Wine,,https://www.vivino.com/wines/20441282,

 Bruised apple (but in a good way), cantaloupe, mango or pineapple, minerals, maybe some apricot, and a little bit of orange and clove.

Look I‚Äôm not a big Piquette fan - for a similar reason that I don‚Äôt like decaf: I‚Äôm not looking to get buzzed, but what‚Äôs the point?

Definite strawberry, cotton candy, honeysuckle, and pear flavors in there somewhere.",,Sparkling,,https://www.vivino.com/wines/172046767,https://images.vivino.com/labels/sWoN1EUiQyGx4cniVom-aQ.jpg

A lot of butter, some apple and pear, cream and stone. I also got the taste of some brioche.

Look it tastes industrial; it‚Äôs one of those wines that‚Äôs consistently consistent. So it has its time and place. But I will usually always prefer to try the wine that will be a bit more uncommon, albeit a little weirder.",,White Wine,,https://www.vivino.com/wines/170589804,https://images.vivino.com/labels/uAAiQnv4RRes9l5I441C8Q.jpg

The flavor hits tart at first, almost like a cranberry and cherry. But then it finishes a little fruity, giving off fruit bomb vibes like strawberry, fruit roll-up. 

I‚Äôm not getting the earthiness people are talking about though. I did get some spices like cloves, and cinnamon. 

Also, it comes in a 1 liter bottle too! More fun for everyone!",,Red Wine,,https://www.vivino.com/wines/176772346,https://images.vivino.com/labels/pHYoaaq0SJuD7IUdx4at8w.jpg

This one had a bit more oakiness to it. With butter being a big flavor but also toast, salt, peach, and a little bit of melon. Also some dried fruit.

It‚Äôs definitely a Rkatselli. A bit of an acquired taste. I thought this one was a little bit more mellow, but the least mellow of tonight‚Äôs tasting.

First flavor you automatically get from all the oxidation that happens is a sherry flavor: a lot of nuttiness with toasted nuts, and walnuts.

First flavor, I immediately noticed with smoke, maybe a little bit of leather, but other than that, it was fruity almost kind of like a melon , hibiscus, peach, and orange.

The only thing I don‚Äôt like is the lack of concentration of flavor. I was expecting more punch.

If I were to rate it again on the second day, I‚Äôd probably give it a 7.1 or 7.0. But it was really good last night.

There‚Äôs tartness like a cherry flavor. I also get a dried flavor like prunes or dried figs. There‚Äôs a lot of spice that I get like cinnamon and pecan and a subtle flavor of apple cider. Also there‚Äôs plenty of blackberry, oak, and plum too. Maybe some chewing tobacco.

First off there‚Äôs a lot of oak and butter. Maybe too much. The other flavors I get are a sharp lemon citrus flavor little bit of grass. Just a little bit of cream with banana.

I did notice it mellows out a bit after opening. When you first open you get the taste of a sour lemon candy hitting you in the mouth.

After a while, that turns a tiny bit more complex, with flavors like grapefruit, honey, and salt.

Plum, milk chocolate, cherry, dried fig, dried fruit, and maybe a smoked tree bark. I think it was that earthy wood flavor that I didn‚Äôt like so much.

I taste honey, butter, pear, minerals, and maybe a yellow peach. Same flavors as the older vintage but maybe they tasted more melodic than the last one. There was still that good acidity that you get from Loire!
